1. Paid apps have higher ratings than free apps

  - It's recommended that the app created will have a price that matches the quality. This could incentivize the creation of a higher quality app, while also maximizing potential profits.

2. Applications that support 10 to 30 languages have higher ratings tha apps that support less or more.

  - It's not about the quantity of languages that are supported, rather choosing the right languages that are supported.
    It is recommended that the app supports a decent amount of languages that are the most widely used. 

3. Apps in the Finance and Book categories have the lowest ratings.

  - This tells the stakeholder that the current apps in these categories are not doing well.
    The stakeholder can capitalize on this and look at the apps that are in that category, see what they're doing/not doing, and create a high quality app for the category to take a lead in the market.

4. Apps that have a longer description have higher ratings

  - The stakeholder should come up with a description that's not too short, but also not too long. A description that's also very meticulously crafted, and accurately describes the app
    so the users know what to expect.

5. The app should rate higher than a 3.5.

  - According to the data, the average user rating across all apps was 3.5. This can be used as a goal metric for the developer, to create an app that would rate higher than average.

6. Games and entertainment category has the most apps out of all categories.

  - The developer should avoid creating an app in this category. With the amount of apps in the category, it suggests a saturated market with very high competition.
  - However, this could also suggest a high demand.
  - Not recommended to enter this market, but could be successful with an original idea.
